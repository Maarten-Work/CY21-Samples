# CY21-Samples

This repository contains a number of different Azure (IoT) related samples.
They can be used to show different scenarios during presentations.
The calendar year (CY), as main repository name, gives an indication about the relevance of the samples.
During the CY, the samples will be kept up-to-date as much as possible. 
However, they might be copied to a new CY to stay up-to-date as long as the samples are still relevant.
